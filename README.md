# IASD privacy
IASD Master Privacy and Anonymization Project

This is a project about the Netflix dataset.

- reproduce the results of the paper Robust De-anonymization of large sparse dataset ( Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov)(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4531148)
- expand the results: in particular, check if we can still de-anonymize the dataset when the movie titles are not given
